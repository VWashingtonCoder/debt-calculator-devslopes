# Debt Free Calculator (Devslopes)

Developer: V. Andreaus Washington (Github: VWashingtonCoder)

You are going to build a debt-free calculator in React. A normal debt calculator will tell you how long a debt will take to be paid off. This calculator will actually keep track of your payments and overpayments.

## üõ† Requirements

1. User enters total debt amount
2. User enters interest rate
3. The app will display how many normal payments it will take to be debt-free
4. There is a "Make a payment" field. The user can set the payment amount. It will calculate the payment against the interest and deduct it from the total debt amount
5. You will require a 1% minimum payment on the principal.
6. Require that the user cannot pay less than the minimum
7. Every time the user makes a payment, you will record that payment and show it in a list of payments, while reducing the overall balance.
8. Every time the user makes a payment, you must first calculate the interest. We will calculate interest annually.
9. The app must include at least two (2) components
  - A component for the form (where a user enters the numbers).
  - A component for payment history

## ‚öñÔ∏è Example:

- The user enters an interest rate of 9.5%. The total loan amount they enter is \$38,000

* Interest = (0.095 / 12) \* 38,000
* Interest: \$300.83

- You will require a 1% minimum payment on the principal.
  - Principal = 38,000 \* 1%
  - Principal = \$380
  - TOTAL PAYMENT: \$680.83

When the user clicks "Submit Payment" you will log this payment in a list and then adjust the balance.

The new balance would be:

- New Balance = Previous Balance - Last Principal Payment
- New Balance = \$37,620

### Overpayment

A user can pay more on the principal. 1% principal payment is required, but more can be added and it will be calculated appropriately. Using the example above, let's make a 2nd payment.

- Balance = \$37,620
- Interest = \$297.82
- Required Principal: \$376.20
- Minimum Payment: \$674.02
- Total user payment (user enters this amount): \$852
- Principal = $852 - $297.82
- Principal: \$554.18
- New Balance = New Balance - Principal Payment
- New Balance = \$37,065.82

### Handle Edge Cases:

Currently, if a user continues to make "minimum payments" of 1% principle, the loan will never be paid off ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- If the total balance is less than or equal to \$100, the minimum payment should be the remaining balance + 1% principle to become debt free .
- Example:
  - Balance = \$87
  - Minimum Payment = Balance + 1% Principle
  - Balance = \$0
  - User is debt-free üí∏
